# Hello_World_Intro

My name is Haley Stessman! I am currently a third year student at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics, with minors in Sport & Rec Manangement and Spanish. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here, thusfar, and am establishing my presence here on GitHub thanks to my Business Analytics Professional Preparation Course. I cannot wait to build and create on this platform.
